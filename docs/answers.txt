	(1.d) Branches allow developers to split (branch) off from a series of commits (the "master branch") and write separate, often,
	experimental features or software elements, separate from the main chain of commits.
	(2.d) Branching has no storage/memory overhead, so it is common practice to do it early and often.

(e)
$ git log : shows the commit logs
$ git status : shows no information with respect to commits to the repository. Presents the entire status (currently) of the 					   working tree (directory) by displaying information on staged files and files that aren't recognized by Git.

(f)
Command:
$ git log --follow -- Weapon.h

(g)
Command:
$ git log --grep=file

(h)
In order to be considered a true object-oriented language, all three of these concepts must be supported.
Inheritance: comprised of two main features, a superclass and a class derived from the superclass, called a subclass. The superclass will pass along all of its attributes and methods to the subclass. Commonly
described as an "is-a" relationship.
Polymorphism: allows for an object to assume several different roles/types. A parent class Shape can 
be used to reference child classes Circle, Square, Rectangle, Triangle, etc.
Encapsulation: revolves around the concept implementation versus interface. Data encapsulation is designed to layer and pack a program in such a way that lower "levels" cannot access data from 
higher "levels" directly. The data can only be interacted with via accessor and mutator
methods within those higher level classes. Essentially things irrelevant to the user are hidden in order 
to prevent fatal errors or erroneous results. A strong analogy is to think of a car driver interacting with the dashboard, but having no idea of the details behind the dashboard.
